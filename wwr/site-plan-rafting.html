            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of establishing an online presence for my rafting business is multifaceted. Firstly, it's about accessibility and convenience for potential customers. By having a website and social media profiles, we make it easier for people to find information about our services, check availability, and even book trips online. Secondly, it's about visibility and marketing. An online presence allows us to reach a broader audience, including those who may not have heard of us through traditional means. We can showcase our unique offerings, share customer testimonials, and engage with our audience through content and interactions. Ultimately, the goal is to increase brand awareness, attract more customers, and grow the business.</p>

Our target audience includes individuals aged 18-45, who are physically active, enjoy outdoor activities, and are looking for unique and exciting adventures to embark on.</p>
