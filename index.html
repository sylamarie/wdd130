            <p>Hello! My name is Syla Marie Cumuyog and I am from Tarlac, Philippines. 
                My hobbies include playing guitar and some piano, as well as playing badminton. 
                I am interested in instruments and enjoy learning new things. 
                My major is software development. There are seven of us in our family; we are five siblings, 
                and I am the middle child. Three of us have served as missionaries: first, my sister served in the 
                Philippines Laoag Mission, then my brother served in the Philippines Cebu Mission, and I served in the Philippines Quezon City Mission.

            <p>The Philippines, located in Southeast Asia, is an archipelago comprised of over 7,000 islands. It is renowned for its stunning beaches, 
                diverse marine life, and vibrant culture. The capital city, Manila, is a bustling metropolis where modernity meets tradition. 
                Filipino cuisine is a fusion of indigenous flavors and influences from Spanish colonization and neighboring Asian countries. 
                Despite facing challenges, such as natural disasters and economic disparities, the Philippines remains a resilient nation with a rich heritage and welcoming people.</p>
